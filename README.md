# Cancer Patient Classification using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This project uses the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to classify cancer patients based on medical features. It includes data preprocessing, visualization, and performance evaluation.

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset used is a modified version of the Breast Cancer dataset. It contains attributes such as:
- Clump Thickness
- Cell Size and Shape
- Marginal Adhesion
- Bare Nuclei
- Chromatin and Nucleoli Details
- Mitoses
- Class (Benign or Malignant)

## 📊 Libraries Used
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 🚀 Steps to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cancer-knn-classifier.git
